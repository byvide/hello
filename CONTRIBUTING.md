If you found something to tweak, hereâ€™s what you need to know:

## PR Guidelines

1. **Commit Messages:** Use standard prefixes for your commit messages, such as `fix: the thing it caused bug`, `chore: the need to do`, `doc: correct a mistake`, etc.
2. **Quality Checks:** The CI workflow only checks the code without modifying it. Make sure to run formatting and optionally the other checks and test as well.
3. **Documentation:** Please don't forget to write or update the JSDocs accordingly.

Thank you for contributing!

_Cheers!_
